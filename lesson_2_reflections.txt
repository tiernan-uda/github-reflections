# 1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a metadata directory containing the files it needs to operate. You
should do this so that you can use git for version control.

# 2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains only the files Git is tracking as opposed to the
working directory which contains all physical files in the directory. This adds
value by allowing you to hand-select which files will be added to each commit.
