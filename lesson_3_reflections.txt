# 1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository when you are collaborating with
others or when you would like a backup in the cloud. I feel like you should
always keep a remote repository.

# 2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You would want to pull remote changes manually so that nothing overwrites or
breaks the changes you have made before you are ready to commit.
